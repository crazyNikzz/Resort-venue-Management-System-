        <h2>Payment Process</h2>
        <p>Thank you for booking with us!
        At our company, we require all payments for venue bookings to be made in cash on the site of the venue. We understand that this may be inconvenient for some customers who prefer to make payments through other means, but we believe that it is the best way to ensure the security and accuracy of transactions. By accepting cash payments on-site, we can quickly verify the amount paid and provide a receipt for the customer. Additionally, it eliminates the risk of fraudulent transactions or errors that may occur when processing payments online or through other channels. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in making cash payments for your venue bookings. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. We hope you have a wonderful event!.</p>

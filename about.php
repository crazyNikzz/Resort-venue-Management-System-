		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>We are a team of experienced event planners who are dedicated to making your event a success. From weddings to corporate events, we have the expertise to help you plan and execute your event with ease.</p>
		<p>At AN Resorts Maharashtra, we understand that each event is unique, and we work closely with our clients to ensure that their vision becomes a reality. Our attention to detail and commitment to excellence is what sets us apart.

        At our company, we require all payments for venue bookings to be made in cash on the site of the venue. We understand that this may be inconvenient for some customers who prefer to make payments through other means, but we believe that it is the best way to ensure the security and accuracy of transactions. By accepting cash payments on-site, we can quickly verify the amount paid and provide a receipt for the customer. Additionally, it eliminates the risk of fraudulent transactions or errors that may occur when processing payments online or through other channels. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in making cash payments for your venue bookings.</p>
